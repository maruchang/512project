# 512project: COVID Analysis 
During the Course Project I took a look at some of the social aspects of the pandemic by conducting a human centered data science analysis of some available COVID-19 data. The course project is consist of four assignments (A4 through A7). Each assignment is slightly different. 
* Assignment A4: Common Analysis sets the stage for the subsequent assignments. In A4 I conducted a base analysis. 
* Assignment A5: Extension Plan - I asked a human centered data science question that extends the work in A4: Common Analysis. 
* Assignment A6: Presentation - I gave a modified (shorter) PetchaKucha presentation of your completed project.
* Assignment A7: Final Report is a written submission of a project report.
